# Phrase and proximity

## PhraseQuery

Matches documents containing the given terms in order.

```csharp
var exact = new PhraseQuery("title", "quick", "brown", "fox");
```

`Slop` allows extra positions between terms. Slop `2` matches "quick X Y brown fox"
in any order within the window.

```csharp
var loose = new PhraseQuery("title", slop: 2, "quick", "fox");
```

Default slop is `0` (exact).

## SpanNearQuery

For nested proximity, use span queries. `SpanTermQuery` wraps a term; `SpanNearQuery`
groups them with a slop and an `InOrder` flag.

```csharp
var near = new SpanNearQuery(
    clauses: new[]
    {
        new SpanTermQuery("body", "machine"),
        new SpanTermQuery("body", "learning")
    },
    slop: 3,
    inOrder: true);
```

Span queries can be combined with `SpanOrQuery` and `SpanNotQuery` for richer
positional logic.
