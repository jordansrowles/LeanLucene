# Filtered vector search

`VectorQuery` accepts an optional filter query. Use it when semantic search must
respect tenant, category, visibility or date constraints.

```csharp
var filter = new BooleanQueryBuilder()
    .Must(new TermQuery("tenant", tenantId))
    .Must(new TermQuery("status", "published"))
    .Build();

var query = new VectorQuery(
    field: "embedding",
    queryVector: embedding,
    topK: 20,
    efSearch: 128,
    oversamplingFactor: 2,
    filter: filter);

var hits = searcher.Search(query, topN: 20);
```

## Filter strategy

LeanLucene chooses the cheapest path per segment:

| Filter shape | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Very selective | Scan only the matched docs |
| Moderately selective | Traverse HNSW with an allow-list |
| Loose | Traverse HNSW, post-filter, then retry if needed |

For broad filters, increase `efSearch` or `oversamplingFactor` if recall matters
more than latency.
